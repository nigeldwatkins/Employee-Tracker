# Employee Tracker Application

## Preview
In the video below I demonstrate how to operate the JavaScript application, Employee Tracker, you will need to open the code inside of a code editor, I would recommend vscode because that is what is being used to demonstrate this application. Open the project Employee-Tracker make sure your current path is server.js. Once you do so install the packages needed to run this application then you can run `node server.js` or `npm start` which will then supply you with a prompt of selections such as view or add departments, employees and roles, you can then add salaries or delete and update any information you want to.
